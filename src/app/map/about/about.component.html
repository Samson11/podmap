    <h5>About</h5>
    <hr>
    <p>Podmap is an <a href="https://github.com/inorganik/podmap">open-source</a> app whose goals are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>to map the world&rsquo;s podcasts</li>
      <li>to help you discover podcasts produced near you</li>
      <li>to help you discover where your favorite podcasts are created</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Add the location of your podcast or help us out by submitting a location for any podcast that doesn&rsquo;t have one yet. <strong>Just start with a podcast search.</strong> Location submissions must be moderated before they appear on the map.</p>
    <p>The granularity of location is confined to cities, so where you may want to enter "Brooklyn, NY" as a location, you&rsquo;ll have to enter New York. Though this is slightly less accurate, it allows for better aggregation.</p>
